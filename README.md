# generativeart
algorithms for generative art in Processing (Java powered)

The program is designed to create generative distorsions over a given image, in this case I included a self portrait artwork of mine.
The funny thing to do with the code is change the image or include a video and see how many fun random creations it gets.

Enjoy,
Alva
